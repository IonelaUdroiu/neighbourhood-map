Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back! This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

#Making a Progressive Web App
By default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first Progressive Web App. 

#Service Workers
The service worker only works in production mode. 
If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.
Service workers are not supported in all web browsers. 

#Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build.

#Static Server

For environments using Node install serve:
```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
The last command shown above will serve the static site on the port **5000**.

#Dependencies
The project uses the following npm packages:

react
google-maps-react
